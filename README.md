### Hello to all programmers and developers in the Github world

👋 He called me **Eliseu** and I'm introducing myself as a Developer and studying as a Systems Development Analysis.

- 🧳Where I live ? Brazilian 
- 💼 My profession? Currently Programmer and Graphic Designer
- 🎓 Are you going to college? Yes Systems Development Analysis
- 😇 are you years old? eighteen

## Your free time?

I really like the program to invent new and expressive things, especially in the Graphic Designer part, I like to travel a lot in arts and try different things.

Also most of my time still can't change, I spend playing League of legends. Sorry!

Obs -> I intend to change this as soon as possible.

### What do I want to achieve?

-🌍I really want to go to canada and have a good condition so that in the future I can help my family in Brazil and develop better as a programmer.

And also having a little place that is not luxury, but what is necessary to sustain me and evolve in what I most need, which is to advance the world, making the most complicated and complex part for many, the programming area.
